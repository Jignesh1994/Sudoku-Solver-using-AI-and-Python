# Sudoku-Solver-using-AI-and-Python By CourseraPrjoectWork

you will create a Sudoku game solver using Python. it's an example of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) in the field of Artificial Intelligence. CSP is a mathematical problem that must satisfy a number of constraints or limitations all the time.

In this project, You will use the Backtracking algorithm to solve CSPs, in a Sudoku game. Backtracking is a recursive algorithm that tries to build a solution incrementally, removing solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints. Eventually, you will be able to use the knowledge acquired from this project on far more complex projects that employ these technologies.

This Work For :
This is for beginners in the field of programming and Artificial Intelligence. It provides you with the first steps to be an artificial intelligence engineer. Moreover, it equips you with the tools needed to use search algorithms in general. It serves as a starting point for many career pathways such as data scientists, machine learning engineers, and even robotics engineers since search algorithms can be used for path planning.

Project Structure:

The hands-on project on Create your own Sudoku Solver using AI and Python is divided into the following tasks:

Task 1: it defines the idea of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem. You will identify the constraints of the Sudoku game and how humans play the sudoku game.
Task 2: Identify the idea of the Backtracking algorithm, and define how artificial intelligence uses Backtracking to solve the sudoku game.
Task 3: Python code to implement the initial structure of the Sudoku game. You will be able to implement three of the four constraints of the Sudoku game.
Task 4: Python to implement the fourth rule of the Sudoku game. You will also identify how to move between cells in the Sudoku game.
Task 5: Python to implement the method that obtains the candidate solutions that do not violate the four constraints of the Sudoku game for any given cell. You will be able to define how to create an exit condition for the Sudoku game.
Task 6: define the difference between the assignment and deep copy in Python programming language. You will implement the recursive algorithm.
Task 7: Implement the Backtracking algorithm using recursion and will be able to define how the Backtracking algorithm can be used to solve the Sudoku game problem.
